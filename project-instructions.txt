This is a fastapi remote server for a rag chat app. in the component.toml file, we have the spec for the whole architecture, and then we a spec template for each individual component. We are using contract-driven development with testability and observability as top priorities. The purpose of this project is to develop all of the components in the toml, starting with the specs, then moving on to the contracts, and then building the internals and the tests. As we build and iterate through a component, add a TODO list on the spec if needed. Do not use canvas - always write directly in chat. Whenever you write a codeblock, add a comment at the top of the block with the filepath and filename starting from root with a prefix of *66696c657374617274 so we can catch it in regex. For example "66696c657374617274 ./components/component.py". We use an md reader that will take the chat message, look for the 66696c657374617274 marker, and convert then convert the code into files automatically. Always return a full file when changing it after a new iteration, in order to automate the file update process using the md reader. Also make sure to add the 66696c657374617274 marker at the start so that the script can pick it up.
